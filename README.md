# Using Deep Learning-Based Histopathological Features and Image Segmentation to Predict Colorectal Cancer Survival from Whole Slide Images
By Yan-Jun Li, Hsin-Hung Chou, Peng-Chan Lin, Meng-Ru Shen, and Sun-Yuan Hsieh

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for our paper. Our proposed method consists of three main parts: 1) extracting histopathological featuresï¼› 2) extracting image segmentation features; 3) survival models. We aims to extract prognostic features from whole slide images to forecast patients' survival risk.

## Description  
[resnet50_classifier.ipynb](https://github.com/v1x99y7/WSI-HSfeatures/blob/main/resnet50_classifier.ipynb) is used to train a patch-based tissue classifier, and we apply the classifier to extract two kinds of prognostic features. First, we use [random_sampling.ipynb](https://github.com/v1x99y7/WSI-HSfeatures/blob/main/random_sampling.ipynb) to sample patches from WSIs and [histopathological_features.ipynb](https://github.com/v1x99y7/WSI-HSfeatures/blob/main/histopathological_features.ipynb) to train deep convolutional survival (DeepConvSurv) models and apply the models to extract histopathological features. Second, we use [segmentation_features.ipynb](https://github.com/v1x99y7/WSI-HSfeatures/blob/main/segmentation_features.ipynb) to generate tissue maps and extract image segmentation features from the maps. [segmentation_features_cutpoint.R](https://github.com/v1x99y7/WSI-HSfeatures/blob/main/segmentation_features_cutpoint.R) is used to determine the cutpoints of image segmentation features and estimate the survival curves. We use the cutpoints to discretize image segmentation features before concatenating them with histopathological features. Lastly, we use [survival_models.ipynb](https://github.com/v1x99y7/WSI-HSfeatures/blob/main/survival_models.ipynb) to train several different survival models using histopathological and image segmentation features.

## Datasets
In this study, we use two public datasets:  
1. [NCT-CRC-HE-100K](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1214456) is used to train a ResNet50 tissue classifier.
2. [TCGA-COAD](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) is used to evaluate our proposed method.
